**PaperScope** is an intelligent research assistant that helps you discover, summarize, and search academic papers efficiently.  
Built with **Gemini**, **FAISS**, and **Streamlit**, it transforms how you interact with research — making exploration faster, smarter, and more insightful. 🧠✨

---

## 🚀 Overview

PaperScope empowers researchers, students, and enthusiasts to:
- 🔍 **Search** papers from **arXiv** instantly by topic, keyword, or direct URL.  
- 🧾 **Summarize** academic papers using **Gemini AI**.  
- 📄 **Upload PDFs** and generate concise summaries.  
- 🔎 **Perform semantic search** using **FAISS** to find contextually similar papers.  

---

## 🧩 Features

### 🔍 Search arXiv Papers
Easily search for recent papers by keywords or provide direct paper URLs (arXiv links or PDF URLs). Get concise, AI-generated summaries powered by Gemini.

**Supported input formats:**
- Keywords: `"reinforcement learning robots"`
- arXiv URLs: `https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12345` or `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12345.pdf`
- Direct PDF URLs: `https://example.com/paper.pdf`

### 🧠 Query Stored Summaries
Retrieve relevant summaries from your saved data using keyword or semantic search.

### 📄 Upload & Summarize PDFs
Upload your own research paper or document — PaperScope summarizes it in seconds.

### 🔎 Semantic Search (FAISS)
Find papers with similar meanings, not just matching keywords, using FAISS-based vector search.

## ✅ Quick start — run locally

These steps will get PaperScope running locally on macOS (zsh) or Linux. The project expects a small configuration file (`paperscope/config.py`) to provide your Gemini API key, the model name to use, and a path for the local JSON DB.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a minimal configuration file at `paperscope/config.py`.
   This repository does not include credentials. Create the file with these three variables:

```python
# paperscope/config.py
API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY"  # keep this secret
MODEL = "your-gemini-model-name"      # e.g. a text/generative model identifier
DB_PATH = "db.json"                   # path for the local JSON database
```

4. Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

5. Open the URL printed by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501) in your browser and use the sidebar to choose actions: Search arXiv, Query Stored Summaries, Upload & Summarize PDF, or Semantic Search (FAISS).

## ⚙️ What the app creates / uses

- `db.json` (or the file you set in `DB_PATH`) — local JSON database of fetched summaries.
- `faiss.index` and `meta.json` — created by the FAISS index builder when you run the "Rebuild Index" action.
- `temp.pdf` — a temporary file used when you upload a PDF from the Streamlit UI.

## 📝 Notes & troubleshooting

- Missing `paperscope/config.py`: the code imports `API_KEY`, `MODEL`, and `DB_PATH` from `paperscope.config`. If you forget to create this file you will see an ImportError. Create the file as shown above.
- Google Gemini / `google-generativeai`: ensure your API key is active and has access to the model you picked. Keep the key secret — do not commit it to git.
- FAISS install issues on macOS: if `pip install faiss-cpu` fails, try using conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge faiss-cpu
```

- If `fitz` (PyMuPDF) import fails, ensure the `PyMuPDF` package is installed (it is listed in `requirements.txt`).

## 🔒 Security and costs

- Using Google Gemini / other generative APIs may incur costs. Monitor usage in your cloud console and set appropriate limits/alerts.
- Never commit `paperscope/config.py` with real keys to a public repository. This file is already included in the project's `.gitignore`, so you do not need to add it yourself.

## 🧪 Demo Mode

PaperScope supports a lightweight Demo Mode so reviewers and curious users can try the app without providing a Gemini API key.

- Enable Demo Mode by setting the environment variable `DEMO_MODE=1` (or `true`/`yes`) before starting the app. Example:

```bash
DEMO_MODE=1 streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

- Demo Mode does not call external generative APIs. Instead, the app returns simplified extractive summaries and deterministic embeddings so the core UI and search flows can be explored offline.
- A banner appears in the UI when Demo Mode is active and some features may be simplified or show the `[DEMO MODE]` prefix in results.
- Demo Mode is intended for evaluation and demos only. For production use or higher-quality summaries, unset `DEMO_MODE` and add a valid `paperscope/config.py` with your Gemini credentials.

### Demo checks

A small verification script is provided to assert demo mode works without external APIs:

```bash
DEMO_MODE=1 python3 scripts/demo_mode_check.py
```

This script saves a sample summary, builds the FAISS index (using local embeddings) and runs a semantic search to confirm the flow works offline.
