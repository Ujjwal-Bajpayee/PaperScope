Code of Conduct
================

Our goal is to build an open, welcoming, and respectful community around PaperScope. All contributors, maintainers, and users are expected to follow this Code of Conduct.

1. Purpose
-----------
We want PaperScope to be an inclusive project where people of all backgrounds can collaborate safely and productively. This Code of Conduct helps set clear expectations about behavior and provides a transparent process for handling reports.

2. Expected behavior
--------------------
- Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
- Be open to constructive feedback and differences of opinion.
- Show empathy and patience toward other community members.
- Use inclusive language and avoid stereotypes.

3. Unacceptable behavior
------------------------
Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:
- Harassment, insults, or hateful language.
- Discriminatory or exclusionary speech related to race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, or nationality.
- Threats of violence, stalking, or unwanted sexual attention.
- Publishing another person's private information without explicit permission.
- Sustained disruption of project collaboration (e.g., abusive comments, doxxing, or repeated antagonism).

4. Reporting
------------
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue titled "Code of Conduct Report" in this repository and clearly describing the incident and any relevant context or evidence. If you prefer not to use the public issue tracker, you can contact the repository owner directly by email (add your preferred contact in the README or maintainers list).

When reporting, please include:
- What happened and when
- Who was involved (if known)
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or links
- Whether you would like the report to be confidential

5. Enforcement
--------------
Reports will be handled promptly and with discretion. Project maintainers will determine appropriate action based on the severity and context of the behavior. Possible responses include:
- A private warning or request to change behavior
- Temporary or permanent banning from project communication channels or contribution privileges
- Escalation to relevant platform or legal authorities if necessary

6. Scope
--------
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the PaperScope project, including GitHub issues, pull requests, commits, chat channels, and any events or meetups organized by project members.

7. Attribution
--------------
This Code of Conduct is intentionally concise and adapted for the PaperScope project. For longer community conduct policies or questions about policy details, maintainers may reference established templates and guidelines.


Thank you for helping us keep PaperScope a welcoming and productive community.
